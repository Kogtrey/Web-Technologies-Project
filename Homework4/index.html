            <p>You go into the cave with no way to protect yourself. You were just coming home from school and you are certainly not a warrior. A laviathan class dragon that lives in the depths of this cave is ont top of you in seconds. Do you fight or run?</p>

            <p>"Seeing as I am just coming home from school there is no need to go into the cave", you think. So you safely make your way home to your family. A few blocks from your house you notice a car is parked with its doors wide open and running. What do you do?</p>

          <div id="resultI3"class="w3-gray w3-container hide">
            <p>Panicking as you do with many decisions, you curl up on the road. Many people drive by you not bothering to stop. You were almost home but you are not brave enough to stand back up and walk. Do you pull yourself together or stay down?</p>

            <p>You try throwing your backpack at the dragon in hopes it would be scared of homework. It glances off of the dragons cheek. This angers the dragon, causing him to roast you in flame. You die...</p>

          <div id="resultA2"class="w3-gray w3-container hide">
            <p>You take off for the entrance of the cave. The dragon cuts you off just as you make the entrance. You were so close but unfortunately begin being dragged back down the cave by the dragon.</p>

            <p>You hop in the car and begin driving. Its a sports car so you decide to test how fast it goes. You hit a max speed of 170mph and crash right through a building, blowing up the car and yourself.  Maybe try not to go that fast in a neighborhood next time.</p>

          <div id="resultB2"class="w3-gray w3-container hide">
            <p>You are obviously not a very curious person so you just keep walking safely home. Avoiding any sort of confrontation or storyline what-so-ever</p>

            <p>Really? You dont want to even try walking anymore? Just want to starve then? Fine. You starve. GG</p>
