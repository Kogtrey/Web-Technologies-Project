# Week2 Log:
* Added necessary folders to github
* Added javascript files that write to console
* Added a lightblue background
# Week3 Log:
 * Added a main page for choosing homeworks
 * Created a basic page for the choose your adventure game
 * Added scripting to show the correct results for the selection picked
 * Made it a bit fancier with easier readability on which option was selected.
 * Added images associated with the result that occured.
## Challenges:
 * Getting the users input to stick after selection and moving it removing it with a new selection. Also a success as I was able to do it in a pretty clean manner
