      <p>You are walking North on a lonely highway when you spot a cave on the mountainside to your west. What do you do?</p>

        <p>You go into the cave with no way to protect yourself. You were just coming home from school and you are certainly not a warrior. A laviathan class dragon that lives in the depths of this cave crushes you in seconds</p>

        <p>"Seeing as I am just coming home from school there is no need to go into the cave", you think. So you safely make your way home to your family.</p>

        <p>Panicking as you do with many decisions, you curl up on the road. Many people drive by you not bothering to stop. You were almost home but you are not brave enough to stand back up and walk. You eventually die of starvation.</p>
